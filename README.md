# Simple CRM # 

Simple CRM is a CRM made for companies that wish to manage their contacts among their team mates.

Although it sounds like an extremely simple concept don't be fooled by the apparent basic functionality. Under the hood this CRM uses a concept called multi-tenancy and in simple terms, it allows each company to have it's very own separate database to store its users and contacts.

Feel free to fork, change, modify and re-use it.

# What is Multitenancy #

A single-tenant application is an application that is used by a single entity, be it a single user or a single company. Itâ€™s not important in this case that the data in this application be kept separate from the other data since all the data belongs to one entity.

A multi-tenancy application is one that can be used by multiple entities at the same time, typically with the data for those entities kept separate from the other entities. When a user signs in, they should only be able to see one set of data, and not the data from other places.
